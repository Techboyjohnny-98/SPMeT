A diagram of the SPMe is below. The SPMe can be run and edited from filename [spme.m](spme.m). Future versions will include the Single Particle Model with Electrolyte and Temperature (SPMeT) dynamics. The SPMe model code is based upon the equations in the publication below.  \r\n\r\n> [\"Battery State Estimation for a Single Particle Model with Electrolyte Dynamics\"](https://ecal.berkeley.edu/pubs/SPMe-Obs-Journal-Final.pdf)  \r\n> by S. J. Moura, F. Bribiesca Argomedo, R. Klein, A. Mirtabatabaei, M. Krstic  \r\n> IEEE Transactions on Control System Technology, to appear  \r\n> DOI: [10.1109/TCST.2016.2571663](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2016.2571663)  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"img/SPMe.png\" alt=\"SPMe Diagram\" width=\"500px\">\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nSpecifically, the code models the following dynamics:  \r\n* Solid-phase lithium diffusion\r\n* Electrolyte-phase lithium diffusion\r\n* Assumes isothermal operation (SPMe only)\r\n* Surface and bulk concentrations of lithium in solid-phase single particles\r\n* Voltage\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Features\r\n* Concentration dependent exchange current density\r\n* Concentration dependent electrolyte diffusivity\r\n* Concentration dependent electrolyte conductivity\r\n* Concentration dependent electrolyte activity coefficient function  \r\n\r\n#### Features not included\r\n* Temperature dynamics\r\n* Temperature dependent electrochemical parameters\r\n* Concentration dependent solid phase diffusivity\r\n* Multiple particle sizes / chemistries\r\n* Aging mechanisms\r\n\r\n### Inputs\r\nThe SPMe requires the following inputs:  \r\n* __Parameter file:__ A parameter file in directory ``/param`` which provides model parameter values that correspond to a particular chemistry. For example, [params_LCO.m](params_LCO.m) provides model parameter values for a graphite anode/lithium cobalt oxide cathode.\r\n* __Input current trajectory:__ A definition or input file in directory ``/input-data`` that provides a time series of electric current applied to the battery cell model in terms of A/m^2.\r\n* __Initial conditions:__ Initial conditions values for the state variables. These include:\r\n  - Voltage ``V0``: Initial voltage. Variable ``V0`` and the moles of solid phase lithium ``p.n_Li_s`` in the parameter structure together are used to compute initial conditions for solid phase lithium ``csn0`` and ``csp0``\r\n  - Electrolyte concentration ``ce0``: Initial concentration of lithium ions in the electrolyte, e.g. ``p.c_e`` from the parameter structure, in units of [mol/m^3]\r\n  - Temperature ``T0``: Initial temperature.\r\n \r\n### Outputs\r\nThe SPMe simulates the following outputs:\r\n* __Bulk State-of-Charge__ ``SOC_n``, ``SOC_p``: Bulk SOC in anode and cathode, respectively. ``SOC_n`` is the typical SOC value reported in any battery-powered device.\r\n* __Voltage__ ``V``: Terminal voltage of battery with SPMe.\r\n* __SPM Voltage__ ``V_spm``: Terminal voltage of battey predicted with SPM model (i.e. without electrolyte subsystem).\r\n* __Solid-phase Lithium concentrations__ ``c_n`` and ``c_p``: Concentration of lithium in the solid phase of the anode and cathode, respectively, as a function of time step ``1:NT`` and radial distance ``r_vec``. Units are [mol/m^3].\r\n* __Surface concentrations of Lithium__ ``c_ss_n`` and ``c_ss_p``: Concentration of lithium at SURFACE of solid phase particles in the anode and cathode, respectively, as a function of time step ``1:NT``. Units are [mol/m^3].\r\n* __Electrolyte-phase Lithium concentrations__ ``c_e``: Concentration of lithium in the electrolyte phase, as a function of time step ``1:NT`` and distance across cell sandwich ``x_vec_spme``. Units are [mol/m^3].\r\n\r\n### Visualizations\r\nTo visualize the SPMe simulation results, run the following code:\r\n* [plot_spme.m](plot_spme.m): Generates one static figure with (i) current, (ii) surface concentrations, and (iii) voltage.\r\n* [animate_spme.m](animate_spme.m): Generates an animated figure with (i) solid-phase lithium concentrations, (ii) electrolyte phase concentrations, and (iii) voltage.\r\n\r\n### Numerical Method Parameters\r\nThe solid and electrolyte phase PDEs are solved with the central difference method and second-order accurate boundary conditions to ensure conservative solutions (i.e. conservation of matter). The accuracy / simulation speed can be adjusted by changing the following parameters.\r\n* ``p.delta_t``: Time step in [sec]. Default: 1 sec\r\n* ``p.Nr``: Number of nodes in finite discretization of single particles. Default: 30\r\n* ``p.Nxn``: Number of nodes along x-coordinate in Anode. Default: 10\r\n* ``p.Nxs``: Number of nodes along x-coordinate in Separator. Default: 5\r\n* ``p.Nxp``: Number of nodes along x-coordinate in Cathode. Default: 10\r\n",
